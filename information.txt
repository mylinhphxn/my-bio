Hi, I'm Mylinh Phan!
I am currently an emerging professional in the Year Up Program, studying at Seattle Central College in hopes of becoming a flourishing Technical Project Manager.
I am passionate for experience and so this new adventure in the tech field is very exciting for me! My interests are diversely spread across the whole spectrum, but my current hobbies are to workout and cozying up to a good book.
I am currently focusing on creating a strong foundation for myself, gaining knowledge in various programing languages and project management courses.
